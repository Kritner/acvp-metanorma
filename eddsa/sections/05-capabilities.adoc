// [#properties]
// == Capabilities Registration
// 
// ACVP requires crypto modules to register their capabilities. This allows the crypto	module to advertise support for specific algorithms, notifying the ACVP server which algorithms need test vectors generated for the validation process. This section describes the constructs for advertising support of EDDSA algorithms to the ACVP server.
// 
// The algorithm capabilities are advertised as JSON objects within the 'algorithms' value of the ACVP registration message. The 'algorithms' value is an array, where each	array element is an individual JSON object defined in this section. The 'algorithms' value is part of the 'capability_exchange' element of the ACVP JSON registration message. See the ACVP specification for details on the registration message.

[[prereq_algs]]
=== Required Prerequisite Algorithms for EDDSA Validations

Each EDDSA implementation relies on other cryptographic primitives. For example, EDDSA uses an underlying SHA algorithm. Each of these underlying algorithm primitives must be validated, either separately or as part of the same submission. ACVP provides a mechanism for specifying the required prerequisites:

| algorithm| a prerequisite algorithm| value| DRBG, DRBG_OPT2, SHA, SHA_OPT2, SHA_OPT3| No

[[supported_modes]]
=== Supported EDDSA Modes Capabilities

The EDDSA mode capabilities are advertised as JSON objects within the 'capabilities' value of the ACVP registration message - see                                                             															
					
                    
                    <<caps_table>>.
The 'capabilities' value is an array, where each array element is a JSON object corresponding to a particular EDDSA mode defined in this section.
