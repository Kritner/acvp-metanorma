| prereqVals | The prerequisite algorithm validations | array | array of prereqAlgVal objects - see <<prerequisites>>
| capabilities | array of JSON objects describing the IUT capabilities for RSA KeyGen | array | array of objects containing each property described below
| randPQ | Key Generation mode to be validated. Random P and Q primes generated as (see <<FIPS186-4>>): provable primes (Appendix B.3.2); probable primes (Appendix B.3.3); provable primes with conditions (Appendix B.3.4); provable/probable primes with conditions (Appendix B.3.5); probable primes with conditions (Appendix B.3.6) | string | "B.3.2", "B.3.3", "B.3.4", "B.3.5", "B.3.6"
